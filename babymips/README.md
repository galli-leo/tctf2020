An initial investigation with file announces that this challenge is gonna be a PITA to reverse, file doesn't know about the architecture:
```
âžœ file babymips
babymips: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, *unknown arch 0xf9* version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-musl-nanomips-sf.so.1, stripped
```

My teammate (xenocidewiki) swiftly pointed out that it is probably nanomips, given the ELF interpreter name. After some researching I found a comprehensive instruction set reference as well as a full fledged linux toolkit, including `objdump`, `qemu` and others. Using `objdump -D`, I was able to get the disassembly of the whole binary and start the reversing process.

However, what further made reversing a PITA was, that `objdump -D` didn't recognize the any of the GOT entries and hence I had no idea which libc functions were called. Luckily the linux toolkit came with `qemu` so I started up the binary using the following command to start qemu with the gdb stub starting on port 1234:

```
nanomips-linux-musl/2018.04-02/bin/qemu-nanomips -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/vagrant/CTF/0ctf/babymips/nanomips-linux-musl/2018.04-02/lib/ -L $PWD/nanomips-linux-musl/2018.04-02/sysroot/nanomips-r6-soft-musl/ -g babymips
```

Next, I connected gdb (`target remote localhost 1234`) and set breakpoints everytime the binary jumps to the GOT. Then I stepped into the libc function and noted its address. Since gdb was also unable to resolve any symbols, I used `objdump` on the libc as well and from the address in gdb I was able to label all GOT stubs.

I finally found the main function (starts at `4006e4`) and started reversing the disassembly. Even though I was very unfamiliar with this architecture, it seemed to be a relatively simple main function:

1. `memset(sp + 12)`
2. `read(0, sp + 12, 62)`
3. `sp + 73 == '}'` (i.e. last character read in)
    * else `puts("Wrong")`
4. `strncmp("flag{", sp + 12, 5)`
    * else `puts("Wrong")`
5. some copy loop, let's say copies flag into buffer `buf`
6. `sub1(buf) == 1`
    * else `puts("Wrong")`
7. `puts("Right")`

Ok, but what does the copy loop do exactly? I also opened up the binary in IDA and although the disassembly was completely unusable, I was able to learn more about the strings / global stuff used in the binary. The copy loop in the main function did something like the following:

```c
char buf[81] = {0};
char data[81] = {0, 0, 'w', 0, /* ... some more static data*/};
char flag[62];

int flag_idx = 5; // we only care about the part inside flag{...}
for (int i = 0; i < 81; i++) {
    if (data[i] == 0) {
        buf[i] = flag[flag_idx];
        flag_idx++;
    } else {
        buf[i] = data[i];
    }
}
```

So it seems to combine the flag chars together with some static data and then execute `sub1` on the combination. Let's take a look at `sub1` now. Again, it is a very simple function, basically just calling three other functions (`sub2`, `sub3`, `sub4`). If any of them return zero, the function immediately returns zero as well and hence the flag is incorrect.

Analyzing `sub2`, `sub3` and `sub4` we learn that they look very similar but differ slightly in the beginning. Since they are all very similar I first fully reversed `sub2` and then could easily determine what the other two did. `sub2` is starting to become more complicated, it has two nested loops. Both go from 0 to 8 (i.e. 9 iterations). This already made me think that it was just iterating over the input buf in blocks of 9, since trivially `9*9 = 81`. And sure enough looking at the disassembly, we see that the basic structure of the function is as follows:

```c
char idx_tbl[81] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 0xa, 0xc, /* ... more static data */};
// buf is not actually taken from the argument here, but stored in the static data of the binary
// I just have this here so it's easier to follow :)
int sub2(char* buf) {
    char tmp[9];
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            char idx = idx_tbl[9*i + j];
            tmp[j] = buf[idx];
        }

        if (sub5(tmp) == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return 1;
}
```

So seems like our task is clear: We need to setup our flag, such that `sub5` doesn't return 0. Let's take a look at `sub5` now. It looks intimidating at first, initializing a bunch of stack variables to zero, then incrementing them in a loop and then finally doing another loop. However, it is actually quite simple.

Both loops have 9 iterations and as such probably use the input buffer (also of length 9). The first loop iterates over the characters in the input buffer, subtracts 97 (i.e. ASCII `'a'`) and then compares the result to 26. If it's bigger than 26 the function returns 0 (i.e. fails). This means we already know that our flag characters are just lowercase letters. Next, it loads an offset from some global data. Looking at the global data in IDA as well as the assembly, it becomes clear that it's some sort of jump table for a switch statement. Further, we can learn that most of the characters lead to an offset of `0x24`. Looking at the assembly, we see that this offset leads to a path that immediately returns 0. Therefore, we can deduce the limited charset our flag can have:

```python
allowed = ['a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'q', 's', 'w', 'x', 'z']
```

With that out of the way, we look into the details of the first loop more. If a character is in the above charset, we increment one of the zeroed stack variables. Which one is incremented depends on the character and is entirely different for all of them. Looking at the second loop, it becomes clear what we have to do. It doesn't iterate over the input buffer, but rather the stack variables. If any of them are not 1, the function will return 0. 

Thus we can deduce our goal for the flag: Blocks of 9 chars in `buf` need to all be of the charset and different. For `sub2`, the blocks are determined by the `idx_tbl`. For `sub3`, the blocks are determined, by iterating over `buf` in steps of 9 (with wraparound). In other words, we use the following code:

```c
int sub3(char* buf) {
    char tmp[9];
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            tmp[j] = buf[j*9 + i];
        }

        if (sub5(tmp) == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return 1;
}
```

For `sub4`, the blocks are just consecutive blocks in `buf` (i.e. expressed in python, block `i` is `buf[9*i:(i+1)*9]`). Having figured out what the checks are, we can easily use z3 to solve for the flag. We don't have to do anything with incrementing variables based on z3 variables (i.e. unknown flag characters), we can just setup constraints, such that any characters in a block are different and constrain them to the charset. We can then create all the blocks in the different manners as explained above, add the constraints for every one of them and let z3 do the hard work. The final flag we get is: `flag{zacedxqsxaqezcscxwzqeczsxddqsxczwaqexczxacdeweasqccsqzae}`
